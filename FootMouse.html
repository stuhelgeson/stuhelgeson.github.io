                <h3>Foot Mouse</h3>
                <br>
                <p>A friend in my lab asked me to help him with a project. He had disabilities in his hands which prevented him from using them to play video games on his computer. He created a work around to control AWSD buttons on a keyboard with his feet, but was having trouble figuring out how to make a mouse he could use with his foot. I worked with him to come up with the Foot Mouse!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I scavenged a cheap tracking ball mouse for its electronics. I then repackaged the components into a device that was more ergonomic. To move the mouse you move the Foot Mouse across the floor. To left click you point your foot.  To right click you push down on your heel. We learned a lot from Version 1. The foot does not like to rest parallel with the floor while balancing on the ball. A move comfortable position, is to raise the foot so it is angled. Also the current design requires a lot more movement to click the button on the front (left click). A new design is being worked to let the user use equal amounts of motion and force to click the two buttons. Expect Version 2 soon!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Here are some renderings made in SolidWorks of Version 1. I'm working on getting some pics of the first version. The prototype was built from press-fitting laser cut acrylic. A spare velcro strap was added to latch it to the users foot. The scavenged electrical components are pressed into cutouts on the underside of the device.</p>
