                <h3>One Two Red Blue</h3>
                <br>
                <p>This is a project from my controls class. Here we have a frame attached to a servo containing a ping pong ball. In the front of the device is a Pixie camera. The whole setup was controlled by an Arduino. This was a closed feedback setup with the Pixie providing position information of the ball. Our task was to write the code to automatically control the position of the ball from the One, to the Two, to the Red, and to the Blue position on the frame. Our team utilized a PID controller to move the servo in the proper position based on the location of the ball. A lot of fine tuning was required to get it just right.</p>
