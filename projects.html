						<h3>Wee Wee Pad Dispenser</h3>
						<p>	Given the details of the decive in the <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US8464662" target="_blank" class="link">patent</a>, I had to design and build a working prototype to demonstrate the fesability of an automated house breaking pad dispensor. The project started with brainstorming ideas on a piece of paper, and grew into the fabrication of a functioning prototype. Along the way I learned a ton, from figuring out what a microcontroller is to building molds and working with composites. It was by no means easy but a challenge I would accept over and over.</p>

						<h3>Robockey</h3>
						<p>The final project in my <a href="https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~medesign/wiki/index.php/Courses/MEAM510" target="_blank" class="link">Mechatronics</a> class, consisted of building an autonomous team of hockey playing robots. My three teammates and I had three weeks to design, build, and code three robots to compete in the tournament. They were built entirely from scratch; the chassis was designed and built using 3D printing and laser cutting, the circuits were designed and soldered by hand, and the code was written from scratch. My main role on the team, was to handle the construction of all the circuitry. I also had a hand in the mechanical design of the bots. This was one of the hardest and most advanced projects I have ever been involved in. To the right you can see a beautiful example of all three robots coming together and working as designed.</p>

						<h3>Sterling Engine</h3>
						<p>In my Machine Design & Manufacturing class, you spend an entire semester machining a stirling heat engine. Every piece is machined out of aluminum, brass and steel using lathes and mills. You learn how to operate industrial machinery but more importantly you learn how things are manufactured. This gives you the ability to think how is this going to be built when you are designing something. On the right is me testing my engine I designed and built for the first time.</p>

						<h3>Wireless Speaker</h3>
						<p class="smaller-text">Here is a wireless speaker I made in Mechatronics. The assignment was to created an speaker that would play a certain range of notes when wireless commands were received. The goal was to bring every speaker together to create a digital orchestra. My speaker was a soprano. The notes were played through the speaker by creating them by filter PWM output of a microcontroller. I coded the microcontroller to output a varying PWM signal that was then sent through a bandpass filter to smooth it into a nice Sine wave. One of my proudest moments in this project occurred while calibrating the frequency of the notes. I plotted the output frequency versus the PWM setting and found that there was an inverse relationship between the two. I was then about to accurately fit a function to the relationship. This allowed the speaker to play a the full variety of frequencies accurately. We also had to design the housing of the speaker. I wanted to test whatâ€™s called a living hinge. You can cut 2D material in such a way so that it will bend. I was very pleased with the results.</p>

						<h3>Digital Art</h3>
						<p>Making digital art is one of my creative outlets. I recently got a tablet with an active digitizer stylus which really opens up a digital medium. With it I am able to take full advantage of Adobe Creative Suite. I look forward to gaining more experience digitally drawing in Photoshop and Illustrator. I like to make personalized wallpapers, both for my phone and my computer. Here are two examples of some phone wallpapers that I made.</p>
