                <p>I am a mechanical engineer and roboticist, in my last semester of study at the University of Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>
                I am interested in product design, robotics, and mechatronics.</p>

                <h3>Labyrinth</h3>
                <br>
                <p>In another mechatronics project, I had to make a joystick controlled cart to cary a 500g weight using only passive electronics. We had to take a PWM signal from the joystick and use a motor driver to control two dc motors. The cart had to be sturdy enough to hold the weight and the motors had to deliver the right amount of torque and speed to navigate the labyrinth smoothly. My motors were a little too fast. This made steering pretty tough. Additionally the joystick was set up so that one stick controlled one motor. This made it extra tough because I couldn't keep them trottled all the way up to navigate through the maze. Instead I was forced to use precise choppy movements of the joystick to control the cart. If I knew how the joystick was set up before I designed the cart, I would have selected motors with a much lower speed that meet the torque requirement.</p>
