                <h3>Speaker</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The orchestra project for my mechatronics class required me to learn how to make a speaker. We had to learn how to filter and amplify signals so the speaker could play tones. I used a microcontroller to vary a PWM output. The code took advantage of the microcontroller's timers to vary the the length of the PWM output. The length was proportional to a sin curve. I then filtered the PWM output to get a clean sin wave. In order to get the frequency of the notes it was playing, I recorded a bunch of data. Each person had to play tones corresponding to their assignment. I was a tenor. I plotted the data in excel and found an inverse relationship between the PWM setting and the output frequency. After fitting an equation, I was able to calculate the PWM setting to play different notes accurately. For the housing I wanted to experiment with a living curve. This is when you cut a 2D material in such a way so it can be used to make a 3D object. I laser cut 1/8" MDF with a pattern then folded it around the speakers frame. I was very happy with the result.</p>
