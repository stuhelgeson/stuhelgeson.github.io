                <p>I am a mechanical engineer, in my last semester of study at the University of Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>
                I am interested in product design, robotics, and mechatronics.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Also in my Intro to Robotics class, we had to make a 3D Haptic enviornment. We used a Phantom Robot as a haptic Device. It using a matlab script made to interface with the phantom to get its position, I coded different 3D objects that had their own unique properties. The enviornment had a haptic button with applied a simulated "click" when it was pressed. This changed the properties of a patch on the floor. The floor went from having viscous friction when the stylus was slid across to having forces applied in the y direction with a magnitude varying sinusoidally as the position changed. This created an artificial rough texture. The 3D enviornment also had repulsive and attractive points that would repel and  attactive the stylus tip respectively. This project was a culmnivation of the course and demonstrated the knowledge I learned throughout the semester.</p>
