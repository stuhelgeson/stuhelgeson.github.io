                <p>I am a mechanical engineer and roboticist, in my last semester of study at the University of Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>
                I am interested in product design, robotics, and mechatronics.</p>

                <p>The final project in my <a href="https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~medesign/wiki/index.php/Courses/MEAM510" target="_blank">Mechatronics</a> class consisted of building an autonomous team of hockey playing robots. My three teammates and I had three weeks to design, build, and code three robots to compete in the tournament. They were built entirely from scratch; the chassis was designed and built using 3D printing and laser cutting, the circuits were designed and soldered by hand, and the code was written from scratch. My main role on the team, was to handle the construction of all the circuitry. I also had a hand in the mechanical design of the bots. This was one of the hardest and most advanced projects I have ever been involved in. To the right you can see a beautiful example of all three robots coming together and working as designed.</p>
