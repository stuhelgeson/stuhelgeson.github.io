                <h3>Insulin Pump Holder</h3>
                <br>
                <p>After having numerous clips for my insulin pump break on me, I decided to try and make my own. I wanted to make a cheap, low profile clip that would keep the pump secure and close to my body. I started by modeling my pump in SolidWorks. Then I designed a clip to slide over the pump. To ensure a quality fit, I cut profiles of the clip into acrylic with a laser cutter. After I tweaked the fit, I sent the file to a MakerBot to 3D print the design. My first iteration wasn't the greatest. The insulin pump had a tendency to slide out of the clip. I updated the design, so that the pump sits vertically and clicks into place. I plan on getting the files for the clip up onto GrabCAD so others can use and tweak it for their own use.</p>
